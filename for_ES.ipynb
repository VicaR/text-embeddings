As this data is used in numerous functions, I would like it to be global. Yes, I can pass pointers around, but I would really like to know how to work with globals in this instance. So, I have device functions that want to access a device allocated array. Ideally, I could do something like: __device__ float* global_data; main() { cudaMalloc(global_data); kernel1<<<blah>>>(blah); //access global data kernel2<<<blah>>>(blah); //access global data again } However, I havent figured out how to create a dynamic array. I figured out a work around by declaring the array as follows: __device__ float global_data[REALLY_LARGE_NUMBER]; And while that doesn't require a cudaMalloc call, I would prefer the dynamic allocation approach. \"}\n",

The strings I need to 'hash' would be mostly single words or some simple construct using two or three words. The answer: One of the FNV variants should meet your requirements. They're fast, and produce fairly evenly distributed outputs. (Answered by Arachnid) \"}\n",

So a model can be updated without being valid overall, and this will still prevent saving invalid data to the database. By \"valid attributes\", I mean those attributes that give nil when calling @model_instance.errors.on(:attribute) Anyone have an idea of how to accomplish this? So far, I have the following: def save_valid_attributes valid? update_atrtibutes attributes.inject({}){|k, v, m| m[k] = v unless errors_on(k.to_sym); m} end This works if there\\'s no processing done on assignment, which in my case there is. For example, I have a database column \"start_date\", and two methods defined: def nice_start_date=(startdate) self.start_date = Chronic.parse(startdate) || startdate end def nice_start_date self.start_date.to_s end These two methods allow me to properly parse the user inputted dates using Chronic before saving. So, second way of doing this, one attribute at a time: def save_valid_attributes(attrib) valid? attrib.each{|(k,v)| send(\"${k}=\", v); save; reload) end The model needs to be reloaded each time since, if one of the dates is invalid and doesn\\'t save, it will prevent all further attributes from saving. Is there a better way to do this? I\\'m sure this isn\\'t an uncommon problem in the Rails world, I just can\\'t seem to find anything in the Google universe of knowledge. '}\n",
